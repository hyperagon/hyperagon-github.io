Hello, I am **Hyperagon** and here are some facts about me:

- I am interested in *Machine Learnind* and making [*Video Games*](https://hyperagon.itch.io/),
- I occasionally sketch on my Android smartphone,
- I love and prefer to use open source ([Linux](https://www.linux.org/)),
- I speak English rather well but it is [very American, not Bri-ish](https://www.speakmoreclearly.com/english-pronunciation-tips/the-difference-between-a-british-and-american-accent/),
- I was previously known as [Vimino](https://vimino.gitlab.io/).
