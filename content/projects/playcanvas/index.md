I tried [PlayCanvas](https://playcanvas.com/) and added some things to its demonstration, it was an interestng experment.

It is great for teams and the fact that it is open-source makes me think that it had something to do with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) but it has no multiplayer built-in, thankfully there is a [plugin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69KpL5Jddis) for it. 
 
# [Play it here](play.html).

Or check the project on [Playcanvas itself](https://playcanvas.com/user/hyperagon).
