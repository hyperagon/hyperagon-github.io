I decided to switch to the much-beloved [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) theme.

## Commands
- `hugo new site <name> ; cd <name> ; git init`
- `hugo new content posts/<title>.md` (set to *draft* automatically)
- `hugo serve -D` (need the -D flag to include *drafts*)

I find it easier to use an ISO Date (YYYY/MM/DD) instead of a title for the files.

## Favicon
To set a favicon I tried many things but the problem was that it used a wrong **base url** so I made it relative with: `baseURL = '.'`

And of course, `favicon = '/static/favicon.ico'`. Which means that I could also just use `favicon = './static/favicon.ico'`

Set all of this in the *.TOML* file.

Also include a `layouts/partials/head/custom.html` with the followeing content:
```
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/static/favicon.png">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/static/favicon.ico">
```
