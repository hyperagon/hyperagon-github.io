Porting the [Untitled Running Game](https://hyperagon.itch.io/untitld-running-game) is getting interesting since I know how the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) works, it's a confortable editor as long as you know what you're doing. Whike unfortunate that you'll likely need to know *GDScript* it is for the best.

Of courae this is teleporting the Player arround and not how you us physics so there's no collision.
