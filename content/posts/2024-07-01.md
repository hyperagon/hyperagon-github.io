Porting the [Untitled Running Game](https://hyperagon.itch.io/untitld-running-game) is getting interesting since I know how the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) works, it's a confortable editor as long as you know what you're doing. Whike unfortunate that you'll likely need to know *GDScript* it is for the best.

Am awesome thing that you can do in the  [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) is defining the script in runtime.
```
func initialize(entity : Node3D, script : Script, path : Array = []):
	# https://forum.godotengine.org/t/scripts-wont-work-after-being-attached-to-node-via-code/9633
	entity.set_script(script)
	if entity.has_method('_ready'):
		entity._ready() # this is required to set non-exported default values
	entity.set_process(true) # if you have processing logic
	entity.set_physics_process(true) # if you have physics logic
	if entity.has_method('_input'):
		entity.set_process_input(true)
	if entity.has_method('step'):
		entity.get_node('Timer').connect('timeout', entity.step)
	if len(path) > 0:
		entity.PATH = path
```

Of courae the scripts are teleporting the Player arround and don't do physics.
