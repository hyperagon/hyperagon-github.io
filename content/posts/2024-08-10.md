So I fixed everything and got it working, 4 player multiplayer **Party Call**. Play it [here, on itch.io](https://hyperagon.itch.io/party-call).

Keep in mind that the web version is the old one where you play against basic AI. You can dinstinguish based on the color of the floor (gray = web, purple = multiplayer).
