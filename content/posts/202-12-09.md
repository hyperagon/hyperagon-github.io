I thought Recur (got some *Nickelodeon*, *Hello Kitty*, *Star Trek* and other NFTs) wasn't even known but saw [SaberSpark talking about it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SGXS2-lh6c&list=PLRxS5SgX8_JmeO6eKIIootsUnq1CZA4tO)
In case you're wondering, it was a [50m rug](https://decrypt.co/153124/nft-platform-recur-to-shut-down-despite-50-million-raise-and-big-name-backers) that, naturally, had huge promises.

Lesson learned, you need money to make money **and** you can never trust others to do it for you.
