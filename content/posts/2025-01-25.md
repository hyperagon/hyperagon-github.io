So I've been watching [Andrej Karpathy's](https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy) videos and he makes good use of [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

I decided to make a post noting how to installl both of these in a [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) environment.
To start off we make said environment.
`python -m venv env`

Then just adtivate it and install everything.
```
source env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade ipython jupyter
pip install --upgrade torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```
You can get the commands from the [Jupyter Lab website](https://jupyter.org/install) and [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), respevtively.
I added the --upgrade to future-proof it.

Now just make a bash script to run it.
```
#!/bin/bash
source env/bin/activate
jupyter notebook
```
And it's ready to use. Do make sure that you are editing **.ipynb** files or you'll get a basi text-editor, it happened to me when editing a **.py** file.
