## Introduction

This is **bold** text, and this is *emphasized* text but you have to open the post to see it.

A `summary` hides the raw content from the post list which looks far more elegant.

I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) as the SSG (Static Site Generator) now. It does not support the [abbr](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/abbr) tag out of the  box which is unfortunate but it is blazing fast.

For anyone wondering, **Ariot I** was the previous [website](https://vimino.gitlab.io/) made with the *Pelican SSG* (Not to be confused with **Excalibur** which was in *Lektor*)
