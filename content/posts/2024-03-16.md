There's a race to make the fastest [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript)
runtime as [Winter.js](https://github.com/wasmerio/winterjs) joins [Bun](https://bun.sh/). [Deno](https://deno.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). Is there some form of race going on?
Granted [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) is outdated but the sudden appearance of many runtimes is a little much.

Trying to direct AIs' is really hard and helper libraries like [GPT-Pilot](https://github.com/Pythagora-io/gpt-pilot) and [Fabric]()) require you to use [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login) and ask you for a key. There are [guides](https://knasmueller.net/running-fabric-locally-with-ollama) to use local LLMs but it's a mess to get them to work in the first place.

I had to update [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) so I re-did `curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh`.
