There's a race to make the fastest [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript)
as [Winter.js](https://github.com/wasmerio/winterjs) joins [Bun](https://bun.sh/). [Deno](https://deno.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)- There's some form of race going on.
Granted Node.js is outdated but the sudden on-flow is a little much.
