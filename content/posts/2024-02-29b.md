Turns out that changing **themes** in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) became quite a nightmarem, I will ~~just stick to regular *git clone* now~~ use submodule as it is forced. It resulted in me just doing it all-over, no more dependency hickups to worry about.

Also, it turns out that the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/) theme hides posts if they have a `type='post'`, an odd little detail that changed between themes but I'm just a novice.

This theme also prefers dates in the `date = 2024-02-24T09:31:08+00:00` format, quite a head scratcher, maybe I was only using the wrong configuration.
