I lowered the requirements by editing `yolov3_train.cfg` to:
```
batch=32
subdivisions=8
```

Thus making training faster. Although it's certainly not as effective.
Another thing I could do is change the image size but I think that this is enough optimization.

```
width=416
height=416
```

It allowed the training to get much further on [Google Colsb](/media/user/Alpha/Documents/AI/colab/script.txt), by saving more often. I also noticed that the time left is variying more often, not staying fixed or just decreasing which may mean that training further is pointless.
