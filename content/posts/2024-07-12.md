I was looking to learn more about when I found [this blog post](https://godotengine.org/article/multiplayer-in-godot-4-0-scene-replication/) which talks about the new multiplayer nodes and provides a [basic example](https://godotengine.org/storage/blog/multiplayer-in-godot-4-0-scene-replication/project.zip).

You can say whatever you want but this, this is gold and far faster than learning how it works step-by-step and hoping to replicate any guide. I now understand how the *MultiplayerSpawner* and *MultiplayerSynchronizer* nodes work. I just hope they're not too heavy since replicating scenes sounds like a lot of work.
