Just adapted and integrated a [numeric detector into my website](projects/detector/detector/).
0Unfortunately there were a few issues that I had to overcome so it took longer than desired.

Creating a separate **test** worked wonders, starting with an all-in-one *HTML* file. This went well with the `rawhtml` tag, provided that I cut some unnecesary things out.
Just be midful that it struggles with the number 4.

Now I can start to improve the model although it's already at 99% accuracy. 😅️
