Just adapted and integrated a [numeric detector into my website](/projects/detector/detector/).
Unfortunately there were a few issues that I had to overcome so it took longer than desired.

Creating a separate **test** worked wonders, starting with an all-in-one *HTML* file. This went well with the `rawhtml` tag, provided that I cut some unnecesary things out.

Now I can start to improve the model although it's already at 99% accuracy. üòÖÔ∏è

Looking at [this post (Going beyond 99%)](https://towardsdatascience.com/going-beyond-99-mnist-handwritten-digits-recognition-cfff96337392?gi=3e1b3833afaf) I learned that it's an exercise from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and that the script trains for **30 epochs**- It's also using *Tensorflow*. So much for my idea of using it directly but changing the number of epochs is easy enough.

And so the Model reached an accuracy of **99.18%**: `Test set: Average los1s: 0.0262, Accuracy: 9918/10000 (99%)`.

Got a errors on the page. To fix it, add `opset_version=9` to your conversion function (`torch.onnx.export`).
From my tessts this is far worse than the example *onnx* model file. Detecting a 4 appears to be beyond it.
