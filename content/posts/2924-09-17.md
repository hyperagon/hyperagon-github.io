Boy, I'm working on *Fam plays Naev* through Minerva Station but it's a huge mission line that will be split into 3 parts.

I'm getting really tired of having to redo missions since my hard-drive doesn't have much space left.

But I prevailed and finished [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY1b0gUF7rA&list=PLoa8A9b-8ZhFvQz0Lh-c6-4tFGsBeVg7z&index=9). [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN2xnSFrLKs&list=PLoa8A9b-8ZhFvQz0Lh-c6-4tFGsBeVg7z&index=10) and [Part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7a6O0XjD4g&list=PLoa8A9b-8ZhFvQz0Lh-c6-4tFGsBeVg7z&index=11).

When looking at the missions in the [source code](https://github.com/naev/naev) I also found out that you get a Station on Chapter 2 (hint: Onion Society) and that's quite exciting, the game never ceases to surprise me as I keep thinking that I've seen the end.
