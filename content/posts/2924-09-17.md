Boy, I'm working on Fam plays through Minerva Station but it's a huge mission line that will split into 3 parts.

I'm getting really tired of having to redo missions since my hard-drive doesn't have much space left. Why does this have so many missions?

But I prevail and finished [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY1b0gUF7rA&list=PLoa8A9b-8ZhFvQz0Lh-c6-4tFGsBeVg7z&index=9). [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN2xnSFrLKs&list=PLoa8A9b-8ZhFvQz0Lh-c6-4tFGsBeVg7z&index=10) and Part 3.
