I participated as an Artist for the [GMTK'24](https://gmtk.itch.io/) that went from August 16 to August 20,
there was a *team finder* and they extended the delivery period by **1 hour** (we had to convert all assets from SVG to PNG), what luck.

My experience was good. It made me realize my limitations and there were a few funny hiccups but we passed through those.

If there's anything that I learned was that you shouls have all images in separate instead of an a single file with everything.
This way the team has the freedom to re-arrange things whenever they want.
