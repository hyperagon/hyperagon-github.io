I've used the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) for quite a while but there is just one annoying thing about it, the separation between user-interface and the visual nodes.
Disclaimer: I'm talking abour **Godot** version **3**.

The problem is that I want to center a node, no matter if it's a *Sprite* or a *TextureRect*, yet there's a big difference in the editor as the first has animation controls while the second has anchors and margins available.
Want to use those features on the other node? Tough luck! You shouldn't be mixing them in the first place.

This is especially annoying since it falls on the "you must learn all about the nodes first" since this means that you need to learn 2 completely separate ones instead of just 1.
