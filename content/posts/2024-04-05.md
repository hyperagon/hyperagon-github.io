As expected I had a ton of issues, like `unmarshal failed: toml: literal strings cannot have new line`. It's expectable given that I was using a newer version of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) but, in that case, it was a typo.

I had to rename `hugo.toml` to `config.toml` like the site generated by using `hugo new site test`.

```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "EMAIL"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
# Set the key up in REPOSITORY > Settings > Deploy Keys
git config --global user.name USER
git config --global user.email EMAIL
git@github.com:USER/REPOSITORY.git
```

Accidentally removedx this file, thankfully **git**  keeps track of every change so I justt followed [this guide]() and did:
```
git log --oneline
git revert COMMIT
```

This made naming all the commits properly much more worth it.
