So I asked **Grok** what time it was and got curious about the counter but it got defensive over my question.

Diablo 1 save-game editor and it kept insisting that it wasn't an MPQ file.
Despite having MPQ in the header... you really have to do a lot beforehand until they can produce anything usable.

So no, it won't replace programmers anytime soon but **they (AIs) are getting better**. Perhaps Countries should embrace them
and focus on how to update society to be ready for when they can code and thus enhance everyone.
