Working on the *Untitled Racing Game* portion of **Party Call** I decided to add the licenses and some screenshots.
Also added some baszic collision detection although it's player-only.
```
	var body = $CharacterBody3D
	if body.move_and_collide(Vector3(x * currentSpeed, 0, z * currentSpeed) * _delta) == null:
		position += Vector3(x * currentSpeed, 0, z * currentSpeed)
		body.position = Vector3.ZERO
	update_animation_tree(_delta)
```
