I got multiplayer working occasionally on the Lobby scene nut it doesn't always work, maybe I should force it to only work on the server and rpc to actually add the Player?

```
set_multiplayer_authority(name.to_int()) # doesn't always work correctly
# https://forum.godotengine.org/t/multiplayer-authority-not-being-set-correctly/40437/3
#call_deferred("set_multiplayer_authority", name.to_int()) # works worse
```

Guess it's back to the [original demonstration](https://godotengine.org/article/multiplayer-in-godot-4-0-scene-replication/) that works quite well. I assume that things will work if I don't overload the connection with information. Example: The chat functionality always works.

Clearly there are [demos](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/master/networking/websocket_chat) that show a websocket chat application and guides to use [ENetfor LAN Multipplayer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d926yfquVM) but it does not allow for using servers or addresses.

This was wasted effort since not even forcing the **server** works every time and the Camera occasionally updates when it shouldn't:

```
func add_player(id: int, char : Node3D = null):
	if char == null and multiplayer.is_server():
		var pick = randi_range(0, CHARACTERS.size() - 1)
		var character = load(CHARACTERS[pick]).instantiate()
		CHARACTERS.remove_at(pick)
		#CHARACTERS.remove_at(pick)
		# Set player id.
		character.player = id
		# Randomize character position.
		var pos : Vector3 = character.position
		character.position = Vector3(pos.x + randf_range(-2, 2), 0, pos.y + randf_range(-2, 2))
		character.name = str(id) # Mulyiplayer Spawner does this
		if randf_range(0, 1) > 0.5:
			character.flip = true
		if randf_range(0, 1) > 0.5:
			character.flip = true
		$Players.add_child(character, true)
		rpc('add_player', id, character)
		if id == 1:
			character.get_node('Camera3D').call_deferred('make_current')
		else:
			rpc_id(id, 'set_camera', character)
	else:
		if char.player != id:
			$Players.add_child(char, true)

func set_camera(character):
	if character.player != 1:
		character.get_node('Camera3D').call_deferred('make_current')
```

I see, after re-reading and some searching I got it, only the server spawns and adds/removes players, I exagerated, both the **MultiplayerSpaner** and **MultiplayerSynchronizer** handle the rest so I have to get out of their way instead of re-doing what they do (replic<ate everything on all peers).
