I got multiplayer working occasionally on the Lobby scene nut it doesn't always work, maybe I should force it to only work on the server and rpc to actually add the Player?

```
set_multiplayer_authority(name.to_int()) # doesn't always work correctly
# https://forum.godotengine.org/t/multiplayer-authority-not-being-set-correctly/40437/3
#call_deferred("set_multiplayer_authority", name.to_int()) # works worse
```

Guess it's baxcck to the original demonstration that works quite well. I assume that things will work if I don't overload the connevction with information.
