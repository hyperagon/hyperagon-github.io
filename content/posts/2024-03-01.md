Got to love it when everything comes together.

I was watching some videos and came to the conclusion that my expectations are well above what my modest setup can do.
Remember that all outputs are cherry-picked, [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is quite interesting and certainly better than just watching videos but threre are many practical exampples playing with common data-sets.
