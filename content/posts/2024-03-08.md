Ok, let's see what I learned got so far. I can train a model *Online* or *Offline* but it still has to fetch the data so it must be *Online*.
The training only had an epoch of 3 and was very inaccurate (around 92%) so increasing the number of epochs would help.

I tried training again and got to 95% but the results aren't any better, meaning that I need to incr4ease the training data or try a different method.
