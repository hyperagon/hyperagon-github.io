Ok, let's see what I learned got so far. I can train a model *Online* or *Offline* but it still has to fetch the data so it must be *Online*.
The training only had an epoch of 3 and was very inaccurate (around 92%) so increasing the number of epochs would help.

I tried training again to 30 epochs but got close to the same accuracy, despite a noticeable size difference on the `model.json` file.

This isn't enough to justify yet another *Number Detector* so I'll leave that for another time and just update the [second one](/projects/detector2/).
