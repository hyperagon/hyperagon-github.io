I was playing around with [PlayCanvas](https://playcanvas.com/) and followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBpwnT201yc).

Notes:
 - The player needs to have the 'Dynamic' tag, the Physics won't work without it
 - You can publish games on the website directly
 - While the tutorial usews **FBX** files, **GLB** (GLTF) files work fine
 - You'll need something like [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) for Mobile. Reminds me of making games with [Phaser,js](https://phaser.io/)
 - It does not come with Physics, you'll need a separate library for that, like the suggested [Ammo.js](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/)
 - ~~The *Published* version is way faster than running it in the *Editor*~~ Plying it on the *firefox* broqwser is way faster than on *Chromium*
