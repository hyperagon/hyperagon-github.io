I was playing around with [PlayCanvas](https://playcanvas.com/) and followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBpwnT201yc).

Notes:
 - The player needs to have the 'Dynamic' tag, the Physics won't work without it
 - You can publish games on the website directly
 - While the tutorial usews **FBX** files, **GLM**/**GLTF** files work fine
 - You'll need something like [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) for Mobile. Reminds me of when I was making games with [Phaser,js](https://phaser.io/)
 - It does not come with Physics, you need a separate libr4ary for that. like the suggested [Ammo.js](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/)
