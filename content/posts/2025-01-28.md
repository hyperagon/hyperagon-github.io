Go figure, the [deepseek-r1](https://www.deepseek.com/) was released in China and it also does a thinking period at test-time like the 200$ ChatGPT-O1 but for way cheaper. I tried it out, it did make a [Snake-game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)= but it took it 2 tries to get the speed right.
