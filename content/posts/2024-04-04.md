Finally installed [Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.org/). It plays very well with my graphics card, opening up the ability to use [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) offline.

Sadly it doesn't support *Secure Boot* so it doesn't play as well with Windows.

I forgot to copy the SSH keys from `~/.ssh` do I'll need to recreate them. Thankfully this is only slightly annoying.
