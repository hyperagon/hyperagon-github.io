I've been thinking about having an AI play Devilution on local multiplayer but it's a pattern matching machine, how could it ever play?

While I found [one article](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/how-to-train-an-ai-to-play-any-game-f1489f3bc5c) about it most results are about the AI making a game.
