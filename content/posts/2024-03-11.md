I looked at [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/about) as yet another option for online M.L., it uses [Mobilenet as the classifier](https://builtin.com/machine-learning/mobilenet) in its base example.
Looking at [this paper](https://dif7uuh3zqcps.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2021/01/17192613/MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-with-Different-CNN-Architectures.pdf), one can see that it is the smallest model with reasonable accuracy.

However, looking at [this post](https://dev.to/atapas/how-i-attempted-image-classification-in-the-browser-using-ml5-js-and-react-1lj3) it's clear that ***ml5.js** is built on top of [tensorflow.js](tensorflow.js) meaning that I'd only be redoing one of my projects in another language.

I later found out about ([ML for Artists, ml4a](https://ml4a.github.io/ml4a/) and saw that it has a lot of number detection demos ([1](https://ml4a.github.io/demos/convolution/), [2](https://ml4a.github.io/demos/convolution_all/), [3](https://ml4a.github.io/demos/f_mnist_input/), [4](https://ml4a.github.io/demos/f_mnist_grid/), [5](https://ml4a.github.io/demos/confusion_mnist/)).
