I looked at [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/about) as yet another option for online M.L., it uses [Mobilenet as the classifier](https://builtin.com/machine-learning/mobilenet) in its base example.
Looking at [this paper](https://dif7uuh3zqcps.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2021/01/17192613/MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-with-Different-CNN-Architectures.pdf) one can see that it 
is the smallest model with reasonable accuracy.
