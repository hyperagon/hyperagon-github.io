Set [Vanilla OS](https://vanillaos.org/) up but the lack of firewall pushes me away. Its *don't worry about it* for my taste.

The browser also froze and I had to close and re-open it but maybe I'm just too used to things working, even if they get slow (Gnome).

I know that it is intended to **virtualize** things so I should run the browser and a firewall in a subsystem but I haven't had any luck in making the apps instaled in the subsystem work.

I-m not ready for this new fad of Linux Distributiions virtualising everything.
