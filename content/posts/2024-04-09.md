Set [Vanilla OS](https://vanillaos.org/) up but the lack of firewall pushes me away. Its *just to don't worry about it* for my taste.

The browser also froze and I had to close and re-open it. But maybe I'm just too useed to things working, even if they freeze (Gnome).

I know that it is intended to virtualize things luck in ualize everything so I should run firefox and a firewall in a subsystem but I haven't had any luck in making any apps insttalled in the subsystem work.
