Fam just played through both [OpenTyrian](https:/tubev=EGz7Ez4pgA4&list=PLoa8A9b-8ZhF39qhcrjvv4m8mfuQY7oDg) and [Tyrian 2000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwzrIBXjeDg&list=PLoa8A9b-8ZhHgi-YSst_EUEIAn8qvj_hT).

It was nice to see such a **classic Shoot-em-Up** (or *shmup* for short).
**Episode 5** airs tomorrow.
