Just learned about [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and [Deno](https://deno.com/), ]Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript).

[Bun](https://bun.sh/) in particular has a lot of [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) and [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C%2B%2B_Programming_Language) explaining the speed that its website boasts. On my CPU-only machine it's great. While [Deno](https://deno.com/) uses [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and Javascript/Typescript.

Also found valuABLE REASOURCES TO IM+RPOVE improving MNIST such as [Techniques to Improve Our MNIST Accuracy Without Using CNNs (99.46% accuracy)](https://medium.com/@anderaquerretamontoro/99-46-accuracy-on-mnist-without-cnn-712042530420) as well as a [repository of articles and their respective code](https://paperswithcode.com/task/rotated-mnist).
