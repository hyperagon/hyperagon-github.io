Just learned about [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and [Deno](https://deno.com/), ]Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript).

[Bun](https://bun.sh/) in particular has a lot of [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) and [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C%2B%2B_Programming_Language) explaining the speed that its website boasts. On my CPU-only machine it's great. While [Deno](https://deno.com/) uses [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and Javascript/Typescript.

Also found valuable resources for improving MNIST such as [Techniques to Improve Our MNIST Accuracy Without Using CNNs (99.46% accuracy)](https://medium.com/@anderaquerretamontoro/99-46-accuracy-on-mnist-without-cnn-712042530420) as well as a [repository of articles and their respective code](https://paperswithcode.com/task/rotated-mnist) and a [website](https://codecraft.tv/courses/tensorflowjs/neural-networks/improving-mnist/#) with a very good warning:

```
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) works on a system of honesty, there are ways to fake the results of your ML algorithm, and there are lots of fake results on the platform. If you look at the MNIST leader-board[3] on Kaggle, youâ€™ll see a whole page of **people who claim to have scored 100% accuracy, which is impossible**. If you look at their code, all they are doing is passing through the test data as model outputs without any machine learning.
```
