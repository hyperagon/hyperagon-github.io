### Add a static file

File in `/content/example/<page>.md`
```
---
title: 'Test 1'
summary: 'Red One'
layout: <layout>
---
```

File in `/layouts/_default/<layout>.html`:

```
{{- define "main" }}
<div class="not-found" style="color:red">One</div>
{{- end }}{{/* end main */ -}}
</html>
```

Don't forget to list it in the configuration:
```
[[menu.main]]
name = "Example"
url = "exaample/"
```
---
### Add raw HTML
{{<rawhtml>}}
{ { < rawhtml > } }
<p align="center" style="color: red;"><strong>This is raw HTML</strong></p>
{ { < /rawhtml > } }
{{</rawhtml>}}

---

### Center the frontface:

Add a CSS file to `/assets/css/extended/<anything>.css` with:

```
.first-entry {
text-align: center;
min-height:3em;
}
```

---
### Favicon
To set a favicon I tried many things but the problem was that it used a wrong **base url** so I made it relative with: `baseURL = '.'`

And of course, `favicon = '/static/favicon.ico'`. Which means that I could also just use `favicon = './static/favicon.ico'`

Set all of this in the *.TOML* file.

Also include a `layouts/partials/head/custom.html` with the followeing content:
```
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/static/favicon.png">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/static/favicon.ico">
