It seems that [Darknet](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) was only using the **CPU**. So I searched a little and found [this bug](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/issues/488#issuecomment-459282463) as well as [another bug](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/issues/2276) that says that we should add `-gpus 0` and `-i 0` to our call. respectivvely.

Adding that, we get:
```
!cd $DN; ./darknet detector -i 0 -dont_show -map train data/obj.data cfg/yolov3-train.cfg backup/yolov3-train_last.weights -gpus 0
```

But what about the other options like **AVX**? If we can force **Darknet** to use the **GPU** we could add those back to the Makefile. right?
```
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39086/search-and-replace-a-line-in-a-file-in-python

f = open(DN + '/Makefile', 'r')
lines = ''
for line in f:
    if line.find('GPU=0') != -1:
        line = line.replace('GPU=0', 'GPU=1')
    if line.find('CUDNN=0') != -1:
       line = line.replace('CUDNN=0', 'CUDNN=1')
    if line.find('CUDNN_HALF=0') != -1:
       line = line.replace('CUDNN_HALF=0', 'CUDNN_HALF=1')
    if line.find('OPENCV=0') != -1:
        line = line.replace('OPENCV=0', 'OPENCV=1')
    if line.find('AVX=0') != -1:
       line = line.replace('AVX=0', 'AVX=1')
    if line.find('OPENMP=0') != -1:
        line = line.replace('OPENMP=0', 'OPENMP=1')
    lines += line
f.close()

g = open(DN + '/Makefile', 'w')
g.write(lines)
g.close()
```

Unfortunately, it still created `6 permanent CPU threads`, which makes me think that it only uses **CPU**s. How unfortunate.
