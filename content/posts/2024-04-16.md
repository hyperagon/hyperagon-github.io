So it seems that [Darknet](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) was only using  the **CPUU**.
So I digged a little and found [this bug](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/issues/488#issuecomment-459282463) that says that we should add `-gpus 0` to our call.

Adding that, we get:
```
!cd $DN; ./darknet detector -dont_show -map train $DN/data/obj.data $DN/cfg/yolov3-train.cfg backup/yolov3-train_last.weights -gpus 0
```
