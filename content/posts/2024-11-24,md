I recently learned about [Redot](https://www.redotengine.org/). a fork of the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/) that was made in response to its [community issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzZhJVgBKiI).
Sadly it's mostly just a recolor for now but it hsf s [game jam](https://itch.io/jam/redotgamjam).

Wait, then [Blazium](https://github.com/blazium-engine/blazium) was made [due to taking donations for things that they did not create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGc6DRaKqH4).

What a mess.
