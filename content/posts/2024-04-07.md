So I get **hacked** every time that I even atempt to reinstall things, how very annoying.

Got no proof? How about this lovely error that I encountered?

```
# update-grub
Sourcing file `/etc/default/grub'
Sourcing file `/etc/default/grub.d/50_linuxmint.cfg'
Sourcing file `/etc/default/grub.d/init-select.cfg'
/usr/sbin/grub-mkconfig: 275: cannot create /boot/grub/grub.cfg.new: Operation not permitted
```

And [*cows turn themzelves inside-out all the time"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ6vAAmoJHw) right?

Anyway I tried [Vanilla OS](https://vanillaos.org/) it's the most tablet-y thing I evwer saw and, despite the added security, wouldn't go well with my setup.
