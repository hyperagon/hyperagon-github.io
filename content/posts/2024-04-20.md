So I fixed the *rawhtml*  issue by updating the version of my theme ([PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod)).
This broke since I needed a newer version of [*HUGO*](https://gohugo.io/) but, after updating, I got it all working.

The question is hoe dpo I update the online variant?
