As you know I've been porting the [Untitled Running Game][(https://playcanvas.com/project/1225672/overview/untitled-running-game](https://hyperagon.itch.io/untitld-running-game)) from [PlayCanvas](https://playcanvas.com/) to [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/). You might be wondering why; it's because it has build-in *collision detection* and *networking*, despite the first seeming web native and working better in that environment I wonder, what changed to Godot's Web Export? It used to work wonderfully but now it needs shared memory. Was it solely due to performance?
