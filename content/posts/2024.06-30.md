As you know I've been porting the [Untitkled Running Game](https://playcanvas.com/project/1225672/overview/untitled-running-game) from [PlayCanvas](https://playcanvas.com/) to [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/). You might be wondering why but it's because it has build-in collision detection and networking, despite the second seeming native for web and worki better in that environment.
