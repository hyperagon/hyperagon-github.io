Was greeted by this little text which is funny, I don't remember personal computers to have System Administrators.

```
We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

For security reasons, the password you type will not be visible.
```

Guess I missed the memo. Also, buying a new computer solved nothing as it got like 1 day free of hacks/system adminidtration. I blame **Windows** on that, such a hackable OS. They changed some things with **Windows 11** but the damage was already done. *Convenience is the
enemy of Security.*

I am stuburn though, a lot of these issues could be avoided if I didn't have my files on the computer.

IÂ«ve learnedd a lot about [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) and [KDE](https://kde.org/) as well as that they are good at and not so much.
