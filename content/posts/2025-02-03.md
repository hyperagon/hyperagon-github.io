I've been playing [DevilutionX](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX) in preparation for **Fam plays** since,
while it does not have cheats per-se, you can move and copy save files (the path is [probably in here](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/blob/master/docs/installing.md)).

[My Save Files](/devilution.zip) have the stash (Gillian) shock full of goodies, both the *Diablo* (.sv) and *Hellfire* (.hsv) versions, although *Hellfire* reset everything.

*Hellfire* brought extra spells, oils, the Monk class and 8 new levels.
