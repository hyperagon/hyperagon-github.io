[Naev](https://naev.org/) is a pretty nice open-source game, a mixture of [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) (it uses the [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) library, that's cool) and [Lua](https://www.lua.org/).

Anyway, the game is quite slow (the bigger the ship the slower) and it takes ages to get to the *heavy stuff*
so I looked to [cheat and found a page](http://denshack.blogspot.com/2016/05/naev-cheats.html) which is outdated (most of them donÂ«'t work) so I digged around and made my own.
