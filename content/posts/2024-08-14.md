[Naev](https://naev.org/) is a pretty nice [open-source](https://github.com/naev/naev/) game, made with a mixture of [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) (it uses the [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) library) and [Lua](https://www.lua.org/).

Anyway, the game is quite slow (the bigger the ship the slower) and it takes ages to get to the *heavy stuff*
so I looked to [cheat and found a page ,which is outdated,](http://denshack.blogspot.com/2016/05/naev-cheats.html) then I digged around and made my own list.

# Walkthrough

## Empire

Å¶ou may find **Liutenant Czesc** in a (Spaceport) Bar at *Gamma Polaris* and he'll give long-distance missions and unlock new types of cargo missions. (requires a standing of 15 with the Empire)

After completing the *Liutenant Czesc* missions you may find **Commander Soldner** in a (Spaceport) Bar at *Gamma Polaris* and he'll give dangerous missions and unlock *Heavy Weapon License* and *Heavy Combat Vessel License* in some shops.

Find **Lt. Commander Dimitri** at the *Omega Enclave* (in Fortitude), follow his missions then **Commodore Keer** will swap for him and tell you to crush the *ESS Trinity* (in Rockbed, get there through Fortitude -> Pontus -> Rockbed) then you'll join the battle on C-59 and C-00. You will be able to buy *Drone Bays* after.

## Sirius

If you go to **Eye of Night** and investigate the distress signal (Ruined Station) you'll get Psychic powers.
Then see *Starring Fyrra* in *Trall* and she'll show you the location of the Kal Tok Obelisk (it's in Ulysses), talk with it with Y and complete its puzzle to obtain the `Seeking Chakra` activated outfit.

## Most Factions

To go to **Chapter 1** you need to sell *Therite*, *Kermite* and *Vixilium* to the bot near the construction site then leave the system.
