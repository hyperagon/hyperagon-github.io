As anyone can see from latest **Darknet** entries, I've made several changes to accommodate [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), some of these involved limits that aren't obvious.

My wish-list is thus:
- Show appropriate warnings/errors when by passing these limits (ex.: RAM)
- Make it easier to view limits int the resource tab
- Show when the **GPU** is being used without having to open the resource tabs
