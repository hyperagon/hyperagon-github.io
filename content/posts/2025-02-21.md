In my attempt to reproduce [this article]([https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-train-an-ai-to-play-any-game-f1489f3bc5c/) I learned that:
1. Stable Baselines is now [**Stable Baselines 3**](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3)
3. Stable Baselines (3) uses [*Gymnasium*](https://gymnasium.farama.org/)

I ran the following in the virtual environment I made for gymnasium (`python -m venv env;source env/bin/activate`, no *miniconda* required):

```
pip install 'stable-baselines3[extra]'
```
