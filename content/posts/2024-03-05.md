Updated [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) by using `pip install --upgrade torch torchvision torchaudio`.
After reading this [guide (PyTorch vs TensorFlow for Your Python Deep Learning Project)](https://realpython.com/pytorch-vs-tensorflow/) I can see that if I'm targetting Javascript I'm better off with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) or [Keras](https://keras.io/).

All of these are supported by pip so run 'pip install tensorfloW' (it also installs keras).

I tried converting [Keras](https://keras.io/) to [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) with no success but found [Keras.js](https://transcranial.github.io/keras-js/) which means that I can skip it altogether.

It has an [example](https://transcranial.github.io/keras-js/#/mnist-cnn) that does a great job at detecting numbers too. Onward to Goal #1, round two!

I used the basic script (train with 15 epochs but save and load the resulting model) and got an accuracy of 99.26% and 99.30% for 15 and 30 epochs, respectively. The file size going from 5.8 MB (PyTorch) to 452.2 KB (Keras) is impressive.

Now for Inference Online, I'll stick to [Tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js).

Rhankfully the MNIST dataset is used in most of these.
