Followed [rhia guide](https://blog.mrhaydendp.com/posts/adding-giscus-to-hugo-site/) to add [giscus](https://giscus.app/) comments to this website.

Sadly it's missing an important detail, at least if you're using the [PaperMod theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/). Here's thre trick:

You must add this to your *.TOML* file:
```
[params]
comments = true
```

And what you get from [giscus](https://giscus.app/) to `layouts/partials/comments.html`:

```
{{- /* Comments area start */ -}}
<script src="https://giscus.app/client.js"
        ...
</script>
{{- /* Comments area end */ -}}
```

Note: This won't work *offline* or without *Javasscript* but every post will now have **comments**.
