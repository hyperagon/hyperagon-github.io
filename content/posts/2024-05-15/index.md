While **darknet** is stuck around *360 hours left* I tested the last weights to see what it got and found that these were oretty much the same as the last ones.

As anyone can see from my latest **Darknet** entries, I've made several changes to accommodate [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), some of which involved limits that aren't very obvious.

My wish-list is thus:
- Show appropriate limit warnings/errors when bypassing limits instead of either/or
- Make it easier to view limits in the resource tab
- Show when the **GPU** is being used without having to open the resource tabs (there is a warning popup but that itn't enough)
