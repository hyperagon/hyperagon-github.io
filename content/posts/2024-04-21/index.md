So I've been noticing some odd behaviors on my machine.
At first it was just an ACPI error, it affects the firmware somehow.

It mostly works despite those errors.

But sometimes it may stop boot altogether:

Or installation failed, stopping me from deploying some distributions.

I have no doubts that someone messed with my sytem. Sure viruses can happpen, even on Linux, but someone put them here.
