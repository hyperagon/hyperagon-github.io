In my attempt to reproduce [this article](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/how-to-train-an-ai-to-play-any-game-f1489f3bc5c) I learned that:
1. Gym is now [**Gymnasium**](https://gymnasium.farama.org/).
2. There's a ton of outdated information out there.
3. *Gymnasium* uses [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/news)
4. *Snake* is not in [their environments](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/)

I ran the following in a virtual environment I made (`python -m venv env;source env/bin/activate`, no *miniconda* required):

```
pip install wheel setuptools pip --upgrade
pip install swig
pip install gymnasium[box2d]
```

Note that [this page](https://gymnasium.farama.org/introduction/basic_usage/) explitly says to use
`pip install "gymnasium[box2d]"` but it only worked for me without the quotation-marks (said it couldn't find swig).
