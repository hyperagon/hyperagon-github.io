I've been playing [DevilutionX](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX) in preparation for **Fam plays** since,
while it does not have cheats per-se, you can move and copy save files (the path is [probably in here](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/blob/master/docs/installing.md)).

### Produced in version 1.5.3

[My Save Files](/devilution.zip) have the stash (Gillian) chock-full of goodies, both the [*Diablo*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_(video_game)) (.sv) and [*Hellfire*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo%3A_Hellfire) (.hsv) versions, although *Hellfire* reset everything and the save has more pages with items.

[*Hellfire*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo%3A_Hellfire) brought extra spells, oils, the Monk class and 8 new levels.

If you're using Windows you may find [the Bobafett Hero Editor](https://github.com/iccugs/bobafett_compiled_with_cheat_table)/[Cheat Engine](https://fearlessrevolution.com/viewtopic.php?t=16678) useful as well as other tools by [Diasurgical](https://github.com/diasurgical).

### Resources (courtesy of [Mistral](https://chat.mistral.ai/chat))
- [Ladik MPQ Editor](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/ladiks-mpq-editor.249562/) (this is an older version but it extracts well)
- [Zezula MPQ Editor](https://www.zezula.net/en/mpq/download.html)
- [StormLib](https://github.com/ladislav-zezula/StormLib) (what the MPQ Editors use)
- [Ghast's Groto](https://mgpat-gm.github.io/index.html) (listfiles, required to know what files are named)

The lisfiles on **Diasurgical** are more complete, like the one for [save-games](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionx-mpq-tools/blob/main/data/save-listfile.txt).
