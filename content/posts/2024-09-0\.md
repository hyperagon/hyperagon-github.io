Recently watched [Wing It!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9lj-c29dxI&list=PLav47HAVZMjnTFVZL-aImCQIC0uLZtNCz&index=1), another [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) Open Movie, creators were having fun with the [Grease Pencil](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/grease_pencil/index.html) feature (useful for making 3D cartoons).

It's too bad that studios don't use it due to the lack of support, forcing users to have to figure things out by themselves (you know, "google it").
