So I used `chkrootkit` and found several suspicious files including `Ç¸etwork Manager`.
Use the `-q`flag to only list suspicious files.

Also got the Colab notebook to continue accordingly by using `$root_dir/yolo-license-plates/yolov3-train_last.weights` instead of `$DN/darknet53.conv.74` as the last argument. Thanks to [this guide](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/issues/1458) for that, while obvious I'm not experienced with **Darknet**.
