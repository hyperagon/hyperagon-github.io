I have tried many things but just can't seem to get the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) to behave as expected. Models take too long to load so their IDs are a mess.

It's annoying since the **scene_replication** demo works just fine but it breaks when I try to adapt it. Making it apparent that it is my fault somehow.

The constant mispressing is a massice handicap (due to typing directly on the laptops keyboard and accidentaly touching the touchpad).
