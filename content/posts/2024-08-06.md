I have tried many things but just can't seem to get the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) to behave as expected. Models take too long to load so their IDs are a mess.

It's annoying since the **scene_replication** demo works just fine but it breaks when I try to adapt it. Making it apparent that it is my fault somehow.

The constant mispressing is a massice handicap (due to typing directly on the laptops keyboard and accidentaly touching the touchpad).

Other htan that I made several versions of **PartyCall** but they all have their issues sdo I keep going back to the demo.

I'm moving a lot slower now. got a basic lounge working with clients occasionsally getting stuck (they don't move despite rotating and animating). And vthankk goodness for the chat which just takes a RichTextLabel (to auto-slide down) and a LienEdit for input.

```
@rpc("any_peer") # required
func _on_line_edit_text_submitted(new_text, origin = true):
	if len(new_text) < 1:
		return

	if origin:
		var who = multiplayer.get_unique_id()
		new_text = str(who) + ": " + new_text + "\n"
		$Control/LineEdit.clear()

	$Control/RichTextLabel.text += new_text
	
	if origin: # only the original sender tells the peers
		rpc("_on_line_edit_text_submitted", new_text, false)
```
