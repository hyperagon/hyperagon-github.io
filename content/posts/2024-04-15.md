So I was unable to do anything with [GitHub](https://github.com/) for a while. That broke my streak of commits but it's back.

In other news I was able to properly use [testdisk](https://html.duckduckgo.com/html?q=twstdiskk) to recover older partitions. Sadly it wasn't able to bypass the maximum of 4 **Primary partitions** despite the [Vanilla OS](https://vanillaos.org/) installer allowing it.

Steps taken:
```
sudo aot install
sudo apt install testdisk
sudo testdisk
[ No Log ]
<HDD>
[ Intel ]
[ Analyse ]
[ Quick Search ]
# Wait then use the Right arrow to chqange the Partition from D(eleted) to P(rimary)
<enter>
[ Write ]
```

Warning: It will mark all existing partitions as **D**, itÂ«s rather annoying.
