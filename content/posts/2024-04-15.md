So I was unable to do anything with [GitHub](https://github.com/) for a while. That broke my streak of commits but it's back.

In other news I was ab√ße to properly use [testdisk](https://html.duckduckgo.com/html?q=twstdiskk) to recover older partitions, sadly it wasn't able to bypass the 4 Primary partition limit despite the [Vanilla OS](https://vanillaos.org/) installer allowing it.
