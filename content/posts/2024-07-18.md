Now I'm working on the Lobby, making it a large plane for players to socialize. I still find the occasional issue and respective fix. Mostly about using *deferred* such as `multiplayer.set_multiplayer_peer.call_deferred(null)` and `$Area3D.set_deferred("monitorable", true` to disable the hotdog monitored (they were being picked up while transparent).
