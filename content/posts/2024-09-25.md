I've been looking around for other *Open Source Games* that are full clones (don't use anything from the original) and found something interesting:
This [list](https://github.com/bobeff/open-source-games?tab=readme-ov-file#role-playing-games), for example, mentions [Naev](https://naev.org/) yet others like [this one](https://www.technorms.com/71807/best-open-source-games) and [this other one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-source_video_games) mention [Endless Sky](https://endless-sky.github.io/) yet not [Naev](https://naev.org/).

Is it because both games are clones of *Escape Velocity*? They are quite different though.

[The plot thickens](https://steamcommunity.com/app/404410/discussions/0/1471967615862590161/) and a fork of Naev called [Nox Iimperi](https://github.com/Kinniken/NoxImperii) appears.

Looking at their Github pages shows that **EV** has more people watching it ([page for Naev](https://github.com/naev/naev), [page for Endless Sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky)).Â´

The *ES* developer state (in 2017) that ```"NAEV has actually been around for quite a long time; it's more than a decade old at this point. Back when I started developing Endless Sky, I considered trying to contribute to NAEV instead, but at that time (late 2013) NAEV had gone over a year without even team blog post, so I wasn't sure it was still alive. (That, and switching back to C if you're a C++ programmer feels like switching back to crayons once you're used to Copic markers.)"```
Fam should play *ES* next. It's 2024 and both games are on Steam.
