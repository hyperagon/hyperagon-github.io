I've been looking around for other *Open Source Games* that are full clones (they don't use anything from the original) and found something particular,
This [list](https://github.com/bobeff/open-source-games?tab=readme-ov-file#role-playing-games), for example, has [Naev](https://naev.org/) yet others like [this one](https://www.technorms.com/71807/best-open-source-games) snd [this other one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-source_video_games) mention [Endless Sky](https://endless-sky.github.io/) yet not [Naev](https://naev.org/).

Is it because both games are clones of *Escape Velocity*?

[The plot thickens](https://steamcommunity.com/app/404410/discussions/0/1471967615862590161/) as a fork of Naev called [Nox Iimperi](https://github.com/Kinniken/NoxImperii) appears.

Looking at their Github pages shows that **EV** has far more people watching it ([page for Naev](https://github.com/naev/naev), [page for Endless Sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky)).
