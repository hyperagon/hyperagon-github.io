I've been looking around for other *Open Source Games* that are full clones (they don't use anything from the original) and found something particular,
This [list](https://github.com/bobeff/open-source-games?tab=readme-ov-file#role-playing-games), for example, has [Naev](https://github.com/naev/naev) yet others like [this one](https://www.technorms.com/71807/best-open-source-games) or [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-source_video_games) have [Endless Sky](https://endless-sky.github.io/) yet no mention of [Naev](https://github.com/naev/naev).

Is it because both games are clones of *Escape Velocity*?
