**Goal #2** will be bringing back [Loopy Looper 4](https://vimino.gitlab.io/play/application/loopy-looper-4/) and adding animations to it like the earlier ones had.

I also updated the licese to [AGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html) since [it is online](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-affero-general-public-license-v3-agpl-3-0).

You can get a Hexagon with `Step: 60 or 300`.
