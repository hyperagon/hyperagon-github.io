I gave an *LLM* ([llamacorn]()) the following prompt:


```
teach me how to use git with examples of commands
I should learn how to use git add -u, git commit and git push
```

Sure, let's get you started with Git. Remember that Git is a distributed version control system that helps you collaborate on projects by allowing multiple people to work on the same codebase in real-time. To get started, you'll need a Git client installed on your computer or server, which can be found online or by downloading a free version of Git.

Install the most recent version of Git on your computer:

Download and install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads
You can also download the Git for Windows (for Windows 10 users) or Git for Mac OS X (for macOS users).
Install a Git client:

- Download and install a popular Git client, such as GitKraken or Atom with Git Support.

- Alternatively, you can use the built-in Git command-line interface on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Log in to your Git account:

Open the command prompt with your Git client installed and log in by typing git config --global user.name "Your Name" (or git config --global user.email "Email Address"), replacing "Your Name" and "Em-ail Address" with your desired username and email.
Once logged in, you can now use Git commands to manage your project files.
Here are the steps to add a new file using Git:

- Open the command prompt or terminal with Git installed on your computer and log in to your account.
In the command prompt, type git add [file-path] (e.g., git add .) and press Enter. This will add the current file to your working directory on Git's server.

- You can now use Git commands to commit your changes by typing git commit -m "Added a new file." (or git add -m "Added [filename]"), replacing "added" or "new file" with your desired text for the commit message.
Here are the steps to commit changes using Git:

Open the command prompt or terminal with Git installed on your computer and log in to your account.

In the command prompt, type git commit (e.g., git commit -m "Added a new file."). This will commit the changes to your Git repository.

You can now use Git commands to push the commits to your remote repository by typing git push (or git push -u origin master) and replacing "origin" with your GitHub's username or SSH key.
