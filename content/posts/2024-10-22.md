I find that [Shotcut](https://www.shotcut.org/) is superior to [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/) in editing but inferior in terms of transition effects. I don't know much about [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/) but I read good things about it.

Video Editing is relatively easy if you have the right tools. Of course, these are open-source and I don't know how they compare to comercial tools like [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) or [Adobe Premiere](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html).
