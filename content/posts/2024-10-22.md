I find that [Shotcut](https://www.shotcut.org/) is superior to [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/) in editing but inferior in terms of transitions/effects.

Video Editing is relatively easy if you have the right tools. Of course, these are open-aource and I don't know how they compare to comercial tools like [Davinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve).
