[Endless Sky]((https://endless-sky.github.io/)) is another [open-source](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky) game, made with [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++).

Similar to [NAEV](https://naev.org/) it was inspired by the **Escape Velocity** gane.
I looked to [cheat and found a discussion,](https://steamcommunity.com/app/404410/discussions/0/154645427521143152/) then I digged around and made my own list to avoid needing [plugins](https://endless-sky.github.io/plugins.html) / [Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org/).
