I've been playing [Endless Sky](https://endless-sky.github.io/) and thought that I was reaching "the end" but was surprised to fiind out thst there is a lot more to do after I found a warp gate in *Ultima Thule* and a red one in *Terminus*.

I guess that yeara of development will lead to a ton of secrets. Just like [NAEV](https://naev.org/).
