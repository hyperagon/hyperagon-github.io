I've been playing *Endless Sky* and thought that I was reaching "the end" but was surprised to fiind out thst there is a lot more to do after I found a warp gate in *Ultima Thule* and a red one in *Terminus*.

I guess that yeara of development will lead to a ton of azecrets. Just like [NAEV](https://naev.org/).
