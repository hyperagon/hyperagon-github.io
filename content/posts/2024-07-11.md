I found a big problem with *WebRTC*, it does not allow for you to make a server, meaning that you have to use something like [Nakama](https://heroiclabs.com/nakama/) or [Photon](https://www.photonengine.com/) (suggested in the [PlayCanvas website](https://developer.playcanvas.com/tutorials/real-time-multiplayer-photon/)), back to [Godot engine's](https://godotengine.org/) [EnetMultiplayer peer](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_enetmultiplayerpeer.html).
