I've been using [(Luma) Dream Machine](https://lumalabs.ai/dream-machine/creations) and getting szome odd results whenever I use cartoon images as input.

"As good as Sora" is quite the stretch although the 30 free generations per month is nice.

[Pika labs](https://pika.art/) gives you 250 credits then 30 per day once that runs out but it struggles with cartoon characters.

[(Luma) Dream Machine](https://lumalabs.ai/dream-machine/creations) moves things a lot more than [Pika](https://pika.art/).
