I've been using [Dream Machine](https://lumalabs.ai/dream-machine/creations) and getting szome odd results whenever I use cartoon images as input.

"As good as Sora" is quite the stretch, although the 30 free generations per month is nice.

[Pika labs](https://pika.art/) gives you 250 credits then 30 per day once that runa out but it also struggles with cartoon characters.

Sadly neither undestand cartoons very well. but [Dream Machine](https://lumalabs.ai/dream-machine/creations) moves thingx a lot more than [Pika labs](https://pika.art/).
