I was getting errors when using `apt update` on **Parrot OS** about `lory`  being mixed with `parrot`.
Turns out that this OS uses two files to list repositorires and they had different configurations.

### sudo nano  /etc/apt/sources.list

```
deb http://deb.parrot.sh/parrot lory main contrib non-free non-free-firmwared
deb-src http://deb.parrot.sh/parrot lory main contrib non-free non-free-firmware
```

### sudo nano  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/parrot.list

Replace `deb https://deb.parrot.sh/parrot parrot main contrib non-free` with `deb http://deb.parrot.sh/parrot lory main contrib non-free non-free-firmware`.

Apparently *lory* is the name for the long term support and there is somwe got confusion on the configuration.

## Update!

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
