I spent the day trying to bring the [second Number Detector](/projects/detector2/) to JavaScript but I was unable to convert a [Keras](https://keras.io/) model into [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js), using the [example model trainer](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/tree/master/mnist) directly.

Now I have to figure out how to make **TF.js** do the same that was done on the first [Number Detector](/projects/detector/).

So far I learned how to [save/load the model](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/guide/save_load), as well as predicting the number based on the model.
