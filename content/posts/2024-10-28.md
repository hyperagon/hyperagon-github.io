I made [*Fam plays (The) Battle for Wesnoth*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj47BQQIPFg) as a side open-source game video. It's meant as a pause for [Endless Sky](https://endless-sky.github.io/) videos.

[(The) Battle for Wesnoth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj47BQQIPFg) is quite an old game but it works wonderfully thanks to years of polish.
