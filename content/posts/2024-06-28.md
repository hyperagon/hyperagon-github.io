So here's a funny story, I decided to do what I had done on [PlayCanvas](https://playcanvas.com/project/1225672/overview/untitled-running-game) in the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/). I made a project and added the models from [Kenney](https://kenney.nl/) but realized that these were in the *FBX* format so I needed to convert them, I went with using *GLB* models which were more in line with open source but, after watching this guide on [using Scene Trees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrMORzl3g1U), I caame to the realization that the animations were not repeating I found [this intereating tidbit](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/140otuf/not_able_to_loop_animation/) which meant that I had to import the *GLB* into the scene, instance it then edit its *AnimationPlayer* (which is denied unless you do the `Animation Player -> Animation -> Manage Animation -> Click Save on the Global animation -> Click on the Save icon -> Select Make Unique` for the first item, it doesn't appear to change anything but it works), the funny part was trying to hardcode it and failing since having an *Animation Tree* will always override your *Animation Player* meaning that no, `animation.loop_mode = Animation.LOOP_LINEAR` will not work.

Here's the resulting Movement.gd:
```
extends Node3D

@onready var animation_tree = $AnimationTree

@export var SPEED : float = 0.1
var isRunning : bool = false

var z = 0
var x = 0

func _input(event):	
	if event.is_action_pressed('ui_up'):
		z = 1
	elif event.is_action_pressed('ui_down'):
		z = -1
	elif event.is_action_released('ui_up') or event.is_action_released('ui_down'):
		z = 0
		
	if event.is_action_pressed('ui_right'):
		x = -1
	elif event.is_action_pressed('ui_left'):
		x = 1
	elif event.is_action_released('ui_left') or event.is_action_released('ui_right'):
		x = 0

func _ready():
	pass
	
func _physics_process(delta):
	isRunning = false
	
	if x != 0 and z != 0:
		isRunning = true
		if z > 0:
			$Rig.rotation_degrees = Vector3(0, x * 45, 0)
		else:
			$Rig.rotation_degrees = Vector3(0, -x * (180+45), 0)
	elif x != 0:
		$Rig.rotation_degrees = Vector3(0, x * 90, 0)
		isRunning = true
	elif z > 0:
		$Rig.rotation_degrees = Vector3(0, 0, 0)
		isRunning = true
	elif z < 0:
		$Rig.rotation_degrees = Vector3(0, 180, 0)
		isRunning = true

	position += Vector3(x * SPEED, 0, z * SPEED)
	update_animation_tree(delta)

func update_animation_tree(delta):
	animation_tree['parameters/conditions/isIdle'] = !isRunning
	animation_tree['parameters/conditions/isRunning'] = isRunning
```
