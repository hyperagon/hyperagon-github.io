So here's a funny story, I decided to do what I had done on [PlayCanvas](https://playcanvas.com/project/1225672/overview/untitled-running-game) in the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) so I made a project and added the models from [Kenney](https://kenney.nl/) but realized that these were in *FBX* so I needed some extra to convert it, I instead went with using *GLB* models which were more in line with open source but, sfter watching this guide on [using Scene Tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrMORzl3g1U), I caame to the realization that the animations were not repeating and, after wandering around, I found [this intereating tidbit](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/140otuf/not_able_to_loop_animation/) so I had to import the *GLB* into the scene, instance it then edit its *AnimationPlayer* (which is denied unless you do the *"Animation Player -> Animation -> Manage Animation -> Click Save on the Global animation -> Click on the Save icon -> Select Make Unique"* for the first item, it doesn't appear to change anything but it works), the funny part was trying to hardcode it and failing since having an *Animation Tree* will always override your *Animation Player* meaning thaat no, "animation.loop_mode = Animation.LOOP_LINEAR" will not work.
