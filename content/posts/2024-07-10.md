Turns out that the method using **ENetMultiplayerPeer** (previously shown) does not work on the web, making it insuficient, what does work however is [**WebRTC**](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/networking/webrtc.html) which requires a [plugin](https://github.com/godotengine/webrtc-native/releases/tag/1.0.6-stable) (just copy **webrtc** to the project) to work on all platforms. There is also a [long guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulfGNtiItnc) on how to use it.

As you cN probably tell, most of what I build involves web technologies and can be played on a browser.
