To setup [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) (what is used in the guide) I did:
- python -m venv env
- source env/bin/activate
- pip install jupyterlab
- pip install notebook
- sudo apt install jupyter-core
- pip install --upgrade ipykernel

Now I run it by using `jupyter labs`, open a file and `shift+enter` to run the selected code segment (mind the requirements).
You can also open `.ipynb` files from the [PyTorch Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/) (Download Notebook) which will work on *cpu* devives.
While optional copy-paste is hard when there are several coder-sections disperszed amongst a body of text.
