I tried to get a fresh instllation of [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) but was met with two issues,

First, running `hugo` gave me:
```
Error: Error building site: process: readAndProcessContent: open /media/user/Parrot/@home/h/ariotII/hyperagon.github.io/public/projects/detector-onnx/onnx.min.js: permission denied
```

Then, using `sudo hugo` gave me:
```
Error: Error building site: "/media/user/Parrot/@home/h/ariotII/hyperagon.github.io/content/posts/2024-03-02.md:36:1": failed to extract shortcode: template for shortcode "rawhtml" not found
```

Finally I followed [a guide](https://andrewu.page/2022/04/insert-raw-html-in-hugo-with-a-simple-shortcode/) to add the rawhtml shortcode and it worked.

Also got a conflict in git, list4ed by using `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U --relative<' then using `git reset --hard` and `git push -f` to resolve it.
