I tried to get a fresh instllation of HUGO but was met with two issues,

First, running hugo gave me:

Error: Error building site: process: readAndProcessContent: open /media/user/Parrot/@home/h/ariotII/hyperagon.github.io/public/projects/detector-onnx/onnx.min.js: permission denied

Then, using * sudo hugo* gave me:

Error: Error building site: "/media/user/Parrot/@home/h/ariotII/hyperagon.github.io/content/posts/2024-03-02.md:36:1": failed to extract shortcode: template for shortcode "rawhtml" not found

Finally I followed this guide yo add the rawhtml shortcode and it worked.

Also got a conflict in git, list4ed by using git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U --relative THEN USING `` to resolve it.
