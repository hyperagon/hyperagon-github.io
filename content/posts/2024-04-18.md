I tried to get a fresh instllation of [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) but was met with two issues,

First, running `hugo` gave me:
```
Error: Error building site: process: readAndProcessContent: open /media/user/Parrot/@home/h/ariotII/hyperagon.github.io/public/projects/detector-onnx/onnx.min.js: permission denied
```

Then, using `sudo hugo` gave me:
```
Error: Error building site: "/media/user/Parrot/@home/h/ariotII/hyperagon.github.io/content/posts/2024-03-02.md:36:1": failed to extract shortcode: template for shortcode "rawhtml" not found
```

Finally I followed [a guide](https://andrewu.page/2022/04/insert-raw-html-in-hugo-with-a-simple-shortcode/) to add the rawhtml shortcode and it worked.

Also got a conflict in git, list4ed by using `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U --relative<' then using `git reset --hard` and `git push -f` to resolve it.

Tried to andd some more news and got this little error:
```
WARN 2024/04/19 13:46:20 Module "PaperMod" is not compatible with this Hugo version; run "hugo mod graph" for more information.
Start building sites â€¦ 
hugo v0.111.3+extended linux/amd64 BuildDate=2023-03-16T08:41:31Z VendorInfo=debian:0.111.3-1
ERROR 2024/04/19 13:46:20 => hugo v0.112.4 or greater is required for hugo-PaperMod to build 
```

Alas, the current `hugo version` says:
```
hugo v0.111.3+extended linux/amd64 BuildDate=2023-03-16T08:41:31Z VendorInfo=debian:0.111.3-1
```

Guess it wasn0t a good idea to follow [this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60269683/how-to-fix-the-error-found-no-layout-file-for-html-for-page-in-hugo-cms) and update my ythene submodule. Thankfully it only afeccts my local machine.
