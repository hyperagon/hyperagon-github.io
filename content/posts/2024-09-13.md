I asked on [Discord](https://discord.com/) about what else I should have Fam play and **bobbens** told me that she could cover the other missions. A great idea since the lack of guides is the exact reason why I'm making them, the puzzles got so hard that I wanteed a guide.

At this point I've played much and can say that I likely found the end of space which has to do with the hidden races behind Sol. I couldn't find much in terms of miaaions for it in the files but they're right there, behind the **Sol** system.
