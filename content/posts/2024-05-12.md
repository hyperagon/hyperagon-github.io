So I mentioned the [Intel Arc GPU](https://www.intel.com.br/content/www/br/pt/products/details/discrete-gpus/arc.html) dued to its 16GB VRAM but what about [CUDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA) support? That's where [ZLUDA](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) comes in.

Also found out a laptop with a $RTX 4090 is available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Blade-Gaming-Laptop-i9-14900HX/dp/B0D21RBD4C) for a whopping 4.5k$, Yikes!
Looking at [their website](https://www.razer.com/eu-en/gaming-laptops/razer-blade-16?page=tech-specs) it becomes clear that both RTX 4080 and 4090 have a lot more vram.
