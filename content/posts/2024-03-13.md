Finished [Goal #2](/projects/loopylooper/), which makes me wonder if it was such a hassle to include animations in the previous one.

Had to use [`setTimeout`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout) since [`setInterval`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setInterval) didn't seem to change *speed* regardless of what **delay** was picked. Rather odd since both of these functions achieve pseudo-asynchronous behavior and may very well be dependent on the other.
