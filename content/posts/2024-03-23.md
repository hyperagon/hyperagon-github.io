Well, testing on a remote machine isn't helping so I'll use `Jupyter Lab` and run it locally.

Okay so the paths were incorrect in both the **obj.data**, **traint.txt**, **test.txt** and **labels.txt**, the last one appears to be ignoreed completely but let's fix them.

```
!echo -e "classes = 1\ntrain = data/train.txt\nvalid = data/test.txt\nlabels = data/labels.txt\nnames = data/cars/classes.txt\nbackup = yolo-license-plates" > $DN/data/obj.data

!cd $DN; find data/cars/images/*.jpeg > $DN/data/train.txt
!cd $DN; find data/cars/images/*.jpeg | head -5 > $DN/data/test.txt
!cd $DN; find data/cars/labels/*.txt > $DN/data/labels.txt

!mv $DN/data/cars/labels/*.txt $DN/data/cars/images
```

(I'm missing a way to say that train.txt should start at line 5)
The last line was added since **Darknet** defaults to label files being next to the images.
