*Apple* finally got into [the space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxe-XpCyHrk). Odd that there's no *Apple Vision Pro* integration.
They say that it respects your privacy which I doubt that since it's the same "all on your device" idea for security band even uses cloud-based or even *OpenAI* for "#harder prompts".

I find it amusing how companies want to "AI" everything but it just shows how much data they have about people and how careless they are with it.

The only unexpected issue is that *Siri* doesn't talk, was that on purpose?
