So I've been looking around for customizable laptops (the "with Linux" ones usually have that feature) and found some valuable resources.
There's a [curated list](https://linuxpreloaded.com/) of providers split by Country as well as a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxhardware/comments/w7m4fl/comment/ihl3l0u/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) with some [reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxhardware/comments/w7m4fl/comment/ihl3l0u/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

Be sure to learn the naming used on hardware by looking up a [handy guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H71IxqmCfxQ).

The problem is the Graphics with many cards stuck at 8GB *VRAM* (Video Random Access Memory). If I don't care about Games and want a capable computer for *Machine Learning*/*Artificial Intelligence* then I need more *VRAM* and all consumer crards are ignoring that niche. Perhaps it is just hard to meet? I think that Desktops can do just fine so why not?
