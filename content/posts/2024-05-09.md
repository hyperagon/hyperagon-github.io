So I've been looking around for customizable laptops (the "with Linux" ones usually have that feature) and found some valuable resources.
There's a [curated list](https://linuxpreloaded.com/) of providers split by Country as well as a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxhardware/comments/w7m4fl/comment/ihl3l0u/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) with some [reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxhardware/comments/w7m4fl/comment/ihl3l0u/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

Be sure to learn the naming used on hardware by looking up a [handy guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H71IxqmCfxQ).

The problem is the Graphics with many cards stuck at 8GB *VRAM* (Video Random Access Memory). If I don't care about Games and want a capable computer for *Machine Learning*/*Artificial Intelligence* then I need more *VRAM* and all consumer crards are ignoring that niche. I think that Desktops can do that just fine so why not?

Intel seems to get the right idea with their Arc Graphics cards some Dell computers have them).

RAM (Random Access Memory) has an [upgrade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3zB9EFntmA) with the LPCAMM2 spec.
Along with moving to [ARMs Snapdragon X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-jqCE_bFGQ) CPUs as seen on [Apple's Macbooks](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-know-if-my-Mac-is-X64-or-ARM).

Future computers will be very interesting.
