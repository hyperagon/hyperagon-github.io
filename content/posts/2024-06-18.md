I'm making a video on what I was able to make wsith [Dream Machine](https://lumalabs.ai/dream-machine), this should be a way to see how basic/advanced it is.

I'll call it something like the "Fam Show" since, as usual, it will involve Fam, my [FoxyFam](https://www.foxyfam.io/).

[Ruenway](https://runwayml.com/) also achieved version 3, making some interesting competition.

Do note that I'm actually using text+image to video and [Dream Machine](https://lumalabs.ai/dream-machine) does a good job.
