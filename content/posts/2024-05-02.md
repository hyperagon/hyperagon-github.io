Saw an [interesting explanation on the Rubber Hose format used in famous characters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyzeP77LZ90).

But [some creations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyE4hZk7EDo&t=2233s) didn't check their licenses since not everything is in the public domain though.

Wi01kipedia has a [handy list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animated_films_in_the_public_domain_in_the_United_States) of cartoons in the public domain.
