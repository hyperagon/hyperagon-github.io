So I heard about [**Flipper Zero**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44O-FNvj8Aw), a portable device that emits and clones several tyes of radio waves, Nothing that you couldn't do with a [Raspberri Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)/[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) and it costs almost the zame as a [Rabbit R1](https://www.rabbit.tech/).

It's funny that a simple brute force attack would work so
