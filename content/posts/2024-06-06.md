[Tech titans are consolidating people](https://youtu.be/p0NxSk7YMrI?t=925), much to the detriment of consumers. With lots of funding and bad business models.
Despite some [impressive open-weight solutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc5nF6rGa68&lc=UgwuyzVxCurIf4SLW5d4AaABAg.A4JaRQNNGEIA4LJQANSOsR).

I'm not entirely sure what shareholders expect though, *Copilot+PC* is a privacy nightmare, especially given *Microsofts* track record (it comes with being the most used OS), and the whole subscription model is doomed to fail unless it guarantees complete security. But, as I said before, convenience is the enemy of security.
